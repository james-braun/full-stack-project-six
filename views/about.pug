            | I have Been into computers since I bought my first Commodore 64 back in 1982. Gosh I hope this doesn't date me. LOL. I remember copying code out of magazines when I was 16 and saving it on magnetic 
            | drives because I couldn't afford a 5 & 1/4 inch disk drive. I have been in love with programimng ever since then. And while I left the computer industry for a while, I'm back full force. You will get the
            | experience of someone who has seen the evolution of the computer from it's infantsy to the mature industry it is today.
